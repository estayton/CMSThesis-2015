The popular narratives about self-driving vehicles cannot have come from
the ether. But what are their roots? What are the sources from which
these stories come, the founts of technological ideology from which
they spring? Journalistic accounts of technological change are of
course impacted by a wide variety of practices and perspectives, from
the market and readership needs of news organizations to the pervasive
culture of commodity scientism.\cite{???-smithCommodityScientism} The
reasons for why these stories are the way they are may be innumerable
and difficult to pin down. But specifically regarding the ways that
driverless cars are figured in the press as autonomous machines, there
are a number of identifiable sources for these modes of writing and
ideological connections: science fiction, factory automation,
artificial intelligence, and engineering and policy documents. Each,
in its turn, impacts the popular narrative in specific and important
ways, which must be understood if we are to come to grips with the
question of why we are receiving a particular story.

\subsection{Science Fictions, Historical Dreams}

Science fiction is a perennial source of popular metaphors and ideas
about technological change, in part perhaps because the visions are so
compelling, but also because they are so easily available. While they
too do not issue forth from a vacuum, coming from a potent combination
of actual engineering and scientific developments mixed with fervent imagination,
science-fiction images represent easily-digestible cultural reference
points for technological stories. From Asimov to \emph{Terminator},
these sorts of pictures are endemic to discussions of Artificial
Intelligence in the press. Visions of robotic drivers are cut from the
same cloth. Stories and ideas about what autonomous cars will be are
influenced by \emph{Minority Report}, \emph{KITT}, and \emph{Total
  Recall}.\cite{???} Countless articles begin by describing
self-driving vehicles as a Hollywood or science-fiction
staple.\cite{???-http://seekingalpha.com/article/2798325-a-window-into-a-driverless-future-from-science-fiction-to-reality} 

Many, indeed most, articles seem ignorant of the actual research
history. Some bring up the pioneering work done by Mercedes and Ernst
Dickmanns in Germany in the 1990s.\cite{???} But few connect
autonomous vehicles today as part of a long research history going
back to the 1960s, and an even longer set of engineering dreams going
back at least to the 1920s. Such narratives would be at least as
valid, in their own way, as connections to science fiction, but I
suggest that some of the shock value of the technology would be lost
by linking it to a deep history of research and effort. Connecting it
instead to the dreams and aspirations of Hollywood cinema makes it
more novel, exciting, even magical. And that hype fits the business
goals of many news outlets interested only in pageviews.

But despite this paucity of historical grounding, certain historically-specific
dreams do filter through into the narratives of autonomous technology
through the media of popular culture and fiction. The Jetsons, though
the show did not actually foreground driverless vehicles, get
remembered due to the role of flying cars, which trigger similar visions of wild
futures made possible through technology.\cite{???} GM's Firebird III, from a
similar era, is remembered due to its publicity campaign and
subsequent cultural presence,\cite{???-http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/12/22/google-vs-tesla-vs-ford-who-has-the-best-self-driv.aspx} despite that the vehicle actually
contained no autonomous technology of any kind.\cite[p. ???]{wetmore} It was
itself an engineering fiction. 

<CAN I FIND A THIRD EXAMPLE???>

These fictions are powerful because they do not answer to logic and
sense. They draw upon emotions, hopes, and aspirations. Driverless cars
are in part works of theater, objects of technological spectacle which
are not yet truly real, despite their existence as physical objects
which can be photographed and experienced. Such real-world contact is
yet limited to a lucky few. Special press events are hosted to allow journalists
to ride in these vehicles.\cite{???} Their capabilities are touted,
advertised, but their media picture is still tightly controlled. Not subsumed
to the mundane, the quotidian, they still possess that magic that
makes science fiction connections obvious and compelling. But this
does not mean such connections are unproblematic. Far from it. By
their alignment of these vehicles to science fiction, popular
narratives curry forward those pictures of the technology already
envisioned, and obscure the multitude of potential implementations
that can emerge from engineering practice in the moment. Self-driving
cars threaten to become natural and obvious, in a particular form,
through their associations with existing, known and culturally
assimilated media portrayals.

But there are other historical images that are part and parcel of
popular autonomous vehicle narratives, ones that are not connected
with vehicles at all. And among these is the assimilated cultural
understanding of the history of factory labor and the automation of work.

\subsection{Accepted Stories of the Automation of Work}
%% 1.1) deep history is the mechanization/automation of work (4 p)
%% --going back to factories/IRev: replacing human competencies with
%% machine competencies and moving the people into new roles
%% --which engages old debates about the role of the human

Human technological progress since antiquity has
involved continual re-negotiations of human labor and the roles of
animals and mechanisms in the labor process. Due to a confluence
of factors---the continuing miniaturization of computing technology, new
advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, a
gradual increase in battery capacities, faster wireless networks---the
horizons for everyday automation are broader now than ever before. 

The popular visions of this technology focus on the future: the
idea that in just two decades the majority of cars on the road will be
fully autonomous. Even respected business information and consulting
bodies have bought into this dream.\footnote{For example, the IHS
  predicts 54 million such vehicles by 2035, which is not as extreme,
  but still a sizable fraction of road vehicles \cite{IHSstudy}} In these vehicles, the users would
step in, select a destination, and would then be free to read, sleep,
watch a movie, answer emails, or otherwise occupy themselves without
needing to pay any attention to the operation of the vehicle. While this
vision has its benefits, it makes many people nervous about
ceding their driving agency to a computer system.\cite{clytton} News articles fret
about what will happen when no one knows how to drive manually any
more,\cite{pross} a classic fear of ``de-skilling'' that is implicated in so many
other implementations of computers. Furthermore, coexistence with
autonomous or automated systems is sometimes presented as a fundamentally new
situation, as if human beings had never before had to work and live
with and next to automated systems, presenting new benefits and
dangers, and requiring new roles for their human tenders.

However, automation already has a deep
history in the industrial sector. Current debates and fears about de-skilling, human jobs,
and the role and value of human labor return us to questions that have
plagued factories, and labor's relationship to machinery, since the
early Industrial Revolution. But as we have already seen with the common
elision of the actual research history of self-driving vehicles, the
stories that get told about driverless cars and factory automation are
primarily those rooted in the cultural consciousness, rather than in
nuanced, factual histories.

<INCLUDE MORE ACTUAL HISTORY>

The early areas of automation which get picked-up by popular attention
include the textile mills of the early 1800s, in which a large
proportion of hand-labor was replaced by steam-powered (in the UK) and
water-powered industrial machinery.\cite{???-fromMRSmithClass} The
story here is a familiar one: skilled artisans made obsolete by the
lower cost and higher productive capacity of mechanical labor. By
analogy, new types of skilled labor (taxi and limousine drivers, or
even bus drivers) are now under threat, and their fate should be no
different than that of the workers who came before.

Robotic cars are sometimes situated as
the next step for robots after the factory, their final emergence into
the real world having conquered the factory floor.\footnote{See for
  example ``Robot Vehicles'' in RobotWorx \cite{robotworx}, which describes automated cars as having the sensors
  industrial robots have had for many years.} The history of
automation that gets mobilized is one of a teleological progression
toward complete automation of all sectors of work. This tendency seems
to be deeply aligned with the struggle of certain groups of
middle-class laborers to keep their jobs in the face of changing
factory conditions. Among the most public and most topical of these
are the Detroit autoworkers, once a bastion of middle-class
respectability, many of whom faced unemployment with the rise of
Japanese (popularly read as: ``highly automated'') automotive
might.\cite{???} There is some truth to this, though the actual story
is far more complicated and has less to do with automation and more to
do with product priorities and other labor
relations.\cite{???-nyeAmericas} actual historical circumstances are
not the point. What matters is the general perception that automated
systems, such as the robotic arms used for painting and assembly, are
reducing the overall pool of available jobs.

This narrative of automation progress was once the province of
blue-collar labor only, but is now moving into white-collar work as
well. Bill Gates, speaking at the American Enterprise Institute,
suggested that a large portion of the workforce will find itself
displaced by robots in the next 20 years, including accountants and
other white-collar
jobs.\cite{???-http://bgr.com/2014/03/14/bill-gates-interview-robots/}
Gate's suggested remedies (low to no taxes and decreasing minimum
wages) are painfully self-serving, but his comments play directly into
contemporary fears about automation, and only support the usual
narrative that job-loss due to automation is inevitable, and workers
should just get out of the way. To this view, the last two hundred
years of innovation in automation is unidirectional and largely
undifferentiated. From steam power to the assembly line, from
Taylorism to roboticization, each was yet another nail in the coffin
of the human worker. But while it is undeniable that automation had changed the
character of human labor, this perceived uniformity in automation
processes is a figment of the collective imagination. For example,
Taylorism, while it attempted to more deeply control and rationalize
the work processes of the individual, in a way mechanizing them, also
created new classes of worker and expanded the role of human managers
in the labor process. An in-depth critique of the traditional
narrative, through a more nuanced discussion of automation
history, is the subject of another chapter. But 
articles that posit factory work as a precursor to the automated
car, without going deeper into that history, implicitly accept a
vision of teleological progress that comes to color the conclusions
and possible futures presented.

Artificial intelligence has its own history, distinct from that of the
automation of work, that feeds into driverless car narratives. Many popular
portrayals of AI care little about the actual history of the field,
and generally pull from major moments that garnered enough popular
attention to enter the cultural knowledge-base: ELIZA, Deep Blue,
Watson, and Siri. But coverage of advances in other artificial
intelligence tasks often cross-pollinates with self-driving car
coverage, either through direct reference or indirect association.
Some appreciation for the history of the field
of AI is important for understanding these moments as they are being
used, as models of progress and evidence of the technological inevitability of
self-driving vehicles. And the technologies of the moment, employed in
cars as well as other AI applications, are critical here. The history
of AI as conveyed through news coverage about self-driving vehicles is
not a complete one, but it is one side of the truth. And even
engineers ignorant of this history may make similar mistakes of understanding.

Intelligent machines are not a new idea. Just as automation has long
been a part of human history, dreams of artificial life suffuse our
legends. The myths about Hephaestus and
his creations, notably Talos, a golden female automaton, come to us
from antiquity,\cite{mccorduck}  but continue to be cited as historical antecedents in
literature on autonomous robots and their ethical issues.\cite[p. 3]{patricklin} Automata,
or rather semblances of automata, appear in Hellenic Egypt, with
priests as puppeteers pulling their strings.\cite[Ch. 1]{mccorduck} The history of
artificial life is intertwined with that of autonomous machines: the
creation of Pygmalion's Galatea echoes the same practices and
concerns, as does the story of Mary Shelley's “modern Prometheus” (of
particular note for the purposes of this argument, Shelley's vision of
artificial life is inspired and physically mobilized by static
electricity, the infusing of a ``spark of being'' into the creature; and
electrostatics were a highly public research topic and indeed public
spectacle, complete with live demonstrations, in the 1700s and early
1800s).\cite[p. 44]{shelley} Judah Loew ben Bezalel, a Talmudic scholar, is in legend the
creator of the golem, a being animated from clay who functioned as a
spy against the Gentiles.\cite[Ch. 1]{mccorduck} Though Loew's was not the only golem
recorded in myth, the rabbi occupies a special position among the most
prominent AI researchers of the 20th century: Pamela McCorduck records
that Marvin Minsky and Joel Moses grew up with a ``family tradition
that they are descendants of Rabbi Loew,'' and Moses claims a number of
other American scientists, including John von Neumann and Norbert
Wiener, also consider themselves among the descendants.\cite[Ch. 1]{mccorduck} This is all
to say that while the technological drivers of conceptual visions are
more contemporary, ancient myth and legend continue to subtly underpin
research in autonomy and artificial intelligence.

%% Drosz and Vaucanson
As Jessica Riskin chronicles in her studies of eighteenth and
nineteenth century automata, clever inventors, interested in going
beyond mere representation, created a variety of impressive
simulations of life---that is simulation in its modern sense, meaning
experimental models that can elucidate the natural, rather than its
contemporary sense which would have meant artifice.\cite[p. ??]{riskinDuck}
Makers of automata strove to imitate the very materials of life,
hoping to ``make the parts of their machine work as much as possible
like the parts of living things and thereby to test the limits of
resemblance between synthetic and natural life.''\cite[p. ??]{riskinDuck}
Automata of this era ``bled,'' ``defecated,'' and ``breathed,'' though some
of these functions were themselves faked, such as in the case of
Vaucanson's Duck. Nevertheless, imitation was central to the project,
and in this way these early automata prefigured at least some of the
developments in AI and Alife. These attempts, though little known and
rarely referenced today, provide critical background for the attempts
that followed. 

%% Steam governors
Many of these automata, despite being surprisingly accurate
mimeses of life, did little in terms of interaction with the
environment. Meaningful interaction requires closing the loop between
sensing and acting in the manner of a
 ``teleological,'' self-governing mechanism with corrective feedback.
 Indicative of Norbert Wiener's later research into cybernetics, such
 corrective feedback mechanisms had been studied since at least the
 late 18th century, when James Watt incorporated a governor into his
 steam engine. Watt himself had pulled from earlier applications of
 governors in windmills, which had been used since at least the 17th
 century.\cite{richardhills} James Clerk Maxwell, most famous for his equations of
 electricity and magnetism published in the 1865 paper ``A Dynamical
 Theory of the Electromagnetic Field'' (among the most important
 equations in physics), published a paper in 1868 on centrifugal
 governors in steam engines in the Proceedings of Royal Society. This
 paper, ``On governors,'' became one of the central papers in early
 control theory.\cite{ottomayr} Bringing together a number of existing
 areas including control theory,
 cybernetics---from the Greek \emph{cybernetes} meaning
 ``steersman''\cite[p. 6]{wienerMainIdeas}---extended their reach to more complex
 systems: ``control and communication in the animal and machine''. As
 Norbert Wiener puts it, control, or the
 feedback mechanism, is necessary for the extension of information
 theory into communication theory. Cybernetics envisions the world in
 terms of feedback mechanisms, which can be used to explain a variety
 of phenomena in living organisms: homeostasis, balance, and motion
 disorders like locomotor ataxia and Parkinsons all fall within the
 cybernetic sphere\cite[p. 10-15]{wienerMainIdeas}. And all are envisioned
 as outcomes of systems that pass messages internally. In this way
 cybernetics is a forerunner of the discipline of
 artificial intelligence, which is interested in re-creating many of the same
 self-regulating systems within computer systems. This replacement of
 competencies tends toward the obsolescence of the human being, and
 again is interpreted in many stories as a teleological process, a
 perpetual advancement of technological competencies.



%% Deep learning
A number of conceptually different approaches to AI have been tried
over the past 50 years, often with deep-seated
ambivalences.\footnote{Ekbia's book does an excellent job
  exploring and cataloging many of these, more than I have space for.
  But logical and neorobotic approaches appear most relevant as
  broad-strokes historical precursors for inclusion here.} Ideas fade
and resurface as fashions change, and greater computational power
allows ``failed'' techniques to be tried anew. But much of this
history is presently unappreciated outside of the discipline. Ours is the age of
statistical AI, and that is what receives attention in the
self-driving car narrative. The buzzword of the day seems to be ``deep learning,'' which
appears to yield radical new possibilities everywhere it is
applied---it really just means a return of neural
networks,\footnote{These systems still have little or nothing to do
  with actual neurons; they are brain-like in only the barest
  toy-model sort of way, despite how they are often represented in the
  press} which, armed with some improvements in weight generation, more layers of
nodes, and more data to train with, have been able to eclipse many of
the previous techniques\cite{???}.

FIND AN NEURAL NETWORK PRIMER I CAN REFER TO\footnote{
(perhaps Jordan, Michael I.; Bishop, Christopher M. (2004). ``Neural
Networks''. In Allen B. Tucker. Computer Science Handbook, Second
Edition (Section VII: Intelligent Systems). Boca Raton, FL: Chapman \&
Hall/CRC Press LLC)}

Neural networks are essentially just a web of nodes with
interconnections between them. They may consist of multiple layers
(hence ``deep'' in deep learning) or may be shallow. Also known as
``multilayer perceptrons,'' such networks have an input layer and
output layer, with one or more intervening hidden layers. Each node
corresponds to a particular feature or combination of features in the
input, and therefore works to classify inputs into different
categories. Each node is also connected to all the nodes in the
following layer with some tunable weight. The process of training the
neural network involves adjusting those connection weights so as to
be more sensitive in distinguishing different types of
inputs.\footnote{THIS ALL NEEDS SOME CLARITY} This tuning,
traditionally, has been done using supervised method and
backpropagation of errors: the output result is compared to an
expected classification result, and the error used to tune the weights
more appropriately. Deep learning extends this technique, decreasing
the amount of ``feature-engineering'' (a human task, identifying the
features the network should use to distinguish inputs) required to
train the system. The ``ideal'' training situation is entirely
unsupervised: the network independently ``learns'' the features of
unlabeled and unclassified input, without any human input. This ideal
prospers both due to convenience in terms of human effort (less
programmer effort required to build labeled sets of training data) and
due to the deep-seated ideology that machine independence is
paramount. Unsupervised learning is often seen as more impressive and
therefore more valuable research.\cite{???}

%% ``self-aware'' mario, image recognition and other
%% claptrap (1) (incl. John von Neumann & ALife (See CMS790 paper)??)
But as has happened before, the AI hype-machine is doing its
work. And popular claims about the utopic promise of deep learning, to
learn about the world ``on its own,''
abound. Google's and Stanford's recent
improvements in image recognition\cite{markoffImage} triggered a wave
of popular speculation about computer vision meeting or surpassing
that of humans. Since vision is the primary sense involved in human driving
and one of the main research areas for automated vehicles, such
advances would seem to translate automatically into the self-driving
car space. Popular articles, though some note that current
state-of-the-art image recognition is still considerably less capable
than people are, still present the uncritical idea that we have solved
the image-recognition problem---or rather, that increases in computing
power mean it will necessarily soon be solved. By this narrative seemingly limitless
possibilities are open before us. As one should expect, the real
history is far more nuanced. But this is the environment that autonomous cars, as a
research area of artificial intelligence, find themselves in today:
part of a new surge (bubble?) of interest in the field, driven by new
or newly extended techniques.


\subsection{Engineering Standards and Policy Documents}

But while some of the conventional driverless car narrative comes from
poor understanding of the technology and history, some also comes
straight from the engineering standards and policy documents set up to
guide the industry's development.
