Human technological progress since antiquity has
involved continual re-negotiations of human labor and the roles of
animals and mechanisms in the labor process. Due to a confluence
of factors---the continuing miniaturization of computing technology, new
advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, a
gradual increase in battery capacities, faster wireless networks---the
horizons for everyday automation are broader than ever. 

The popular visions of this technology focus on the future: the
idea that in just two decades the majority of cars on the road will be
fully autonomous. Even respected business information and consulting
bodies have bought into this dream.\footnote{For example, the IHS
  predicts 54 million such vehicles by 2035, which is not as extreme,
  but still a sizable fraction of road vehicles \cite{IHSstudy}} In these vehicles, the users would
step in, select a destination, and would then be free to read, sleep,
watch a movie, answer emails, or otherwise occupy themselves without
needing to pay any attention to the operation of the vehicle. While this
vision has its benefits, it makes many people nervous about
ceding their driving agency to a computer system.\cite{clytton} News articles fret
about what will happen when no one knows how to drive manually any
more,\cite{pross} a classic fear of ``de-skilling'' that is implicated in so many
other implementations of computers. Furthermore, coexistence with
autonomous or automated systems is presented as a fundamentally new
situation, as if human beings had never before had to work and live
with and next to automated systems, presenting new benefits and
dangers, and requiring new roles for their human tenders.

However, automation already has a deep
history in the industrial sector. Current debates and fears about de-skilling, human jobs,
and the role and value of human labor return us to questions that have
plagued factories, and labor's relationship to machinery, since the
early Industrial Revolution.

Robotic cars are sometimes situated as
the next step for robots after the factory, their final emergence into
the real world having conquered the factory floor.\footnote{See for
  example “Robot Vehicles” in RobotWorx \cite{robotworx}, which describes automated cars as having the sensors
  industrial robots have had for many years.} But just what the
processes of standardization, mechanization, and automation (or
“automatization”) have done to the factory, and to laborers in it, is
not clearly understood among many who write about autonomous cars. Within this
forgotten history—which is substituted for by an imagined person-less
factory that does not exist in the real world—there are even lessons to be
learned by the research community. This past is relevant, perhaps
more than ever, to the future of transportation.

A search for the beginnings of industrial automation takes us to the middle of
the 18th century: Vaucanson's mechanical loom dates to 1741, and formed the basis of
 later developments in weaving by Joseph Marie Jacquard.\cite{dieboldImpact} 
But the first true example of industrial automation originating in the
United States does not come until Oliver Evans' work in the 1780s on
automated grist mills.\cite{roesmithYankee} Through a series of elevators and descenders,
horizontal screws, spreaders and rakes, his mill moved grain from raw
agricultural commodity to finished product: sifted flour. And ideally,
all parts of the process would occur without human intervention. 

In reality, the process both increased efficiency and decreased the costs
of production, so much so that the same basic machinery is still in
use today in some smaller milling operations.\cite{wyegrist} None of his individual
inventions—which he lists as the elevator, ``conveyer,'' hopper-boy,
drill, and descender in his 1795 miller's guide—was a particularly
groundbreaking achievement, but what Evans did was place these devices
in succession so as to allow continuous production, and the
elimination of many slow human jobs that degraded the quality of the
product by tracking dirt and contaminants around inside the mill.\cite{evansMillguide} 

It took some time for the high level of automation found in the Evans
mill to spread across other industries, and the mill may find its
closest cousins in the ``automatic'' factories of the 1950s and 1960s
and the roboticized factories of today, but Evans's contemporaries
were not uninterested in increasing efficiency and output. Paul
Revere, one of America's early industrialists, applied shifts in
manufacturing techniques to transition himself from an
artisan worker to manager and overseer of others over his long
metalworking career.\cite{martello} Like a small number of his postrevolutionary
contemporaries, he improved his circumstances by becoming a manager
and owner rather than a laborer, but manufacturing itself was a site of public
debate, pitted against the ``inherent virtue'' of agricultural pursuits.
Tench Coxe, a political economist, wrote in 1810 that ``new machines
and power sources allowed even greater productivity with less labor,
further underscoring the connection between technology and republican
virtue.''\cite{coxe} To Coxe's romantic view, these machines  worked ``as if they
were animated beings, endowed with all the talents of their inventors,
laboring with organs that never tire, and subject to no expense of
food, or bed, or raiment, or dwelling.''\cite{martello} 

But these romantic words did not represent the whole reality of
industrial machine labor. Human labor of
maintenance and supervision is implicit in these manufacturing
machines, but it is rendered invisible by the rhetoric that the
machines themselves require no bed or board. At the same time, Coxe's
use of the word “endowed” should focus our attention on exactly which
of the “talents” of the inventors have been automatized, and the human
labor necessarily involved in that conferring of capabilities. 

Arsenal practice was the site of multiple revolutions in U.S.
manufacturing technology through the 1800s and early 1900s, notably
the development of the so-called “American system” of interchangeable
parts, through which a gradual increase in mechanization would seem to
continue, driven by the tight tolerances necessary for this production
method. And yet armorers and managers at Harper's Ferry resisted the
mechanization of their craft,\footnote{Blanchard's
  many automatic machines for making
gunstocks were of particular importance,\cite{roesmithHarpers} but a wide variety of
machinery was implemented in the gun-making process at Harper's Ferry. Most of these machines still
required significant human labor. Nash's barrel-turning machine in part mechanized the production of
barrels of standardized dimensions: it consisted of a lathe on a
wooden frame, with human-operated props to hold the barrel in place.\cite{roesmithHarpers}
The worker also had to continually measure the barrel with a caliper,
and adjust the device's chisel appropriately.\cite{roesmithHarpers} This gradual
implementation of mechanized labor was continued in further machines
produced by Hall. His straight-cutting machine, an early version of a
milling machine, had as its distinctive feature the ability to be
tended by ``common hands'' without a loss of
accuracy.\cite{roesmithHarpers}, and while certain competencies were
transferred from the skilled worker
to the technical apparatus, human oversight and operation was still
integral to the production of weaponry using the new technology. It was
not clear until after the fact that more mechanization was necessarily
better: Harper's Ferry remained ``competitive'' with Springfield's
costs through the mid 1830s.\cite{roesmithHarpers}

The same exchange of competencies characterized Ford's assembly line
production as well, which is cited by David Hounshell as the rise of
true mass production in America.\cite{hounshell} Ford's factory developed fixtures
and gauges, designed to allow for use by unskilled machine tenders. As Donald
Norman writes in Things that Make us Smart—itself, reminiscent of Ed
Hutchins's cognitive anthropology and work on distributed cognition
systems—“the world remembers things for us, just by being
there.”\cite{normanThings} But while the gauge simplifies the
assurance  of quality, it does not
automate it: it simply changes the effort from a more complex judgment
of quality and measurement to a simpler one. While he instituted the
five-dollar day to attempt to solve labor problems at the factory, and
compensate laborers for becoming part of the “production machine,”
Ford also attracted a wide variety of well-educated skilled mechanics
to his automobile plants.\cite{hounshell} Like Evans, Blanchard, Hall, and others
before them, these mechanics applied their skills to design machines,
and simplify and standardize work processes. The individual judgment
of the assembly line laborer was displaced into standardized tools and
fixtures, built into these technologies by the labor of skilled
machinists and designers.

Meanwhile, Taylorism in factories created “new managerial
functions” performed by “new classes of people with new titles and
more clearly specified responsibilities.”\cite{aitken} A focus on the
people—who are they? where are they? what are they doing?—shows that
one of the fundamental and enduring characteristics of Taylor's
system, the expansion of management roles and the further division of
labor, is not about mechanical automation but about new and altered
types of human work. Industrial processes in the early 1900s continued
the removal of management and strategic decision making from the
workers most physically engaged in product production, installing it
instead within formal organizational structures and the employees that
constituted them. 

This pattern of delayed recognition and contingent change repeats for
numerical control in assembly line production. Numerical control (NC),
developed in the 1940s and 1950s as an outgrowth of World War II
research into feedback systems, slowly began to produce industrial
robots that could perform factory tasks without direct human
intervention. Robots slowly began to replace assembly line jobs such
as spray painting and welding, but adoption was gradual, with only
about 6,000 robots in use in American factories by the mid
1970s.\cite{nyeAmericas} Industrial robots, while automating tasks,
had a way of generating large contingents of skilled human laborers
who still needed to be paid for their services. Industrial robots were
complicated, and needed a variety of skilled workers to tend them, and
to repair them when the broke down. These early experiments did not
increase profits because of the volume of highly skilled labor needed
to keep the machines operating.\cite{nyeAmericas} The development of NC machines
proceeded with a specific interest in eliminating skilled workers, but
the jobs that disappeared were largely unskilled or semi-skilled
laborers.\cite{nyeAmericas} And while Norbert Weiner, in his 1950 book The Human Use of
Human Beings, prophesied the end of “deadly uninteresting” jobs, which
would be mechanized within 20 years, such changes have still not
totally come to pass.\cite{nyeAmericas} To compound the problem, new industries of
skilled workers—record-and-playback machine designers, and NC machine
programmers—sprang up to furnish factories with their tools.

The process of standardization,
mechanization, and automation has been a process of attempting to
wrest control of the production of components from those closest to
handling them and concentrating it in the hands of management. The Air Force's Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing program (ICAM)
brings to light further complexities in the story of the automated
factory: ICAM attempted to aid shop floor automation by automating certain
management functions, “to try to reduce the enormous indirect costs
that have resulted from the effort to reduce labor costs and remove
power and judgment from the shop floor,” costs that have continued to
dog new rationalization strategies.\cite{nobleForces} ICAM, like the mythical
ouroboros, sought to offer automation as the “solution to the problems
generated by automation,” providing automated scheduling functions,
inventory control, and design tools to “provide better management
control” and “free management from excessive routine duties to do
creative work”—the creative work that the management had attempted to
place in their own hands, in the first place, through earlier
processes of rationalization.\cite{nobleForces}  Automation, Noble's ICAM example shows,
can be used both to routinize work—for the manual laborer—and to
eliminate the routine in favor of the creative—for managers and newly
generated classes of creative workers. 

%% Noble cites 330, 330
Automation may look very different depending on where in the hierarchy
a person happens to fall, but the historical lesson is that human
involvement remains, though altered in space, time, and kind. As John
Diebold pointed out in 1953, there will be ``no worker-less
factories as a result of automation.''\cite{dieboldNew}

So we come to our first of many contradictions at the heart of
automated vehicle research. Their promise:
to provide to us a greater measure of creativity in the act of
driving, to remove some of the “menial” and routine tasks of manual
control in favor of strategic decision-making. In this analogy, the
driver goes from being the manual laborer to the creative manager. But
despite a focus on relieving tedium, this is not the way these systems
have primarily been envisioned. Instead, in the process of following
the dream of fully automated operation--where the human labor has been
entirely removed from the shoulders of the person in the vehicle, and
displaced to the invisible labors of mapping, programming, and
monitoring---engineers are designing systems where the ``driver''
seems present largely to ensure the operation of capital-intensive
machinery, burdened with new but perhaps even more menial tasks of
machine tending.\footnote{See for example Tom Simonite, “Lazy Humans
Shaped Google's New Autonomous Car,”\cite{simonite}  which discusses
the human role within Google's test vehicle,
and the company's response. This is purely speculation, but due to
the way the system operated previously, it is possible at least one Google
employee fell asleep at the wheel, which was the catalyst for their
concern and change in focus.} 

Why might this be? To understand it, we must understand something
about AI history, and the ideologies intertwined with artificial
intelligence research.
