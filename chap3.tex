-other autonomy research
--researchers in the field
-some stakes (data) are still applicable, but others may be
ameliorated

\subsection{Whither Alternate Stories?}



1) bring in the telerobotics/supervisory control literature
-why supervisory control? and where is it used? (5 p)
-examine the issue of deskilling vs. the ``irony of automation'' well
known in Human Factors, in which increased automation actually
increases human load (2 p)
-but SC allows for particular combinations of human skills and machine
competencies (1 p)
--used all over industry, aviation, undersea (2 p)


3) situate the moonshot approach (which may actually be easier in some
senses but less socially acceptable) and the mixed approach in a way
that does not support a teleology of autonomous vehicle development
(think Sheridan's graph of telerobotics, not the SAE's 5 stages) (4 p)
--in historical context of previous systems that are wholly or
partially autonomous (4 p)
