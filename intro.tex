Intro / Visions / Public Faces (14 p)

>>>Story hook: currently, this calls out to be a brief historical
sweep through self-driving car dreams from the 1920s/30s to the
present; but it could also begin with the reveal of the Google car; or
the Youtube video of the guy in the Mercedes tricking the lane assist
function to drive for him on the highway (2 p)

1) establish what the technology is: in its varied types and
dimensions: this is not ONE THING or ONE IDEA (4 p)
---INCLUDING historical models: see Erkki Huhtamo, media archaeology
(2 p)

2) deal in general with some of the popular portrayals of the
technology: the nature of the self-driving car as it will appear in
the near future is not self-evident, no matter how loud Google's voice
or how large their investment (4 p)
---you would be excused for thinking XYZ, based on what you read in
the popular press
---but this is a flawed picture of the future, and an incomplete
picture of the tech

3) and shift to the lead-in to the main thesis sections: that these
technologies or visions of them enact certain ideologically charged
activities (through their epistemologies; or even to some extent
ontological position of a self-driving car that ``knows'' nothing);
and that these can be traced through the histories and current
discourses of the fields involved, and lead us to expect very
different social/cultural impacts (2 p)
